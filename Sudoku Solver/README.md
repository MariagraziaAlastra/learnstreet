Welcome! Here is a Sudoku Solver project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

A Sudoku is a 9 x 9 grid which is further subdivided into nine 3 x 3 zones. Like a crossword puzzle, each Sudoku puzzle starts with some cells already pre-filled. To successfully solve the Sudoku, each row of the grid must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, all columns 
must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, and all the 3 x 3 zones must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9.

Try it out!
