Welcome! Here is a Mastermind project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using javascript.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

Test your code-breaking mojo with Mastermind, a two-player strategy game that challenges you to solve your opponent's secret combinations.<br><br> In this project, you will write the code that checks your guesses and gives you feedback until you figure it out!

Try it out!
